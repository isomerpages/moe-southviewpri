and competent learners and we are committed to giving every child a strong
start. Our holistic curriculum and programmes nurture children’s confidence,
social skills, bilingualism and build a good foundation in literacy and
numeracy.</p>
<p>At the physical Open House, parents are welcomed to tour the learning
environment and speak to the MK Educators in person. MK Open House details
