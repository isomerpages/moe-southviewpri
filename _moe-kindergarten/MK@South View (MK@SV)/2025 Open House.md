<p><strong><u>MOE Kindergarten 2025 Open House &amp; Registration Exercise</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Are you looking for a quality and affordable kindergarten programme for
your preschool child?</p>
<p>At MOE Kindergarten, we believe that children are joyful, curious, active
and competent learners and we are committed to giving every child a strong
start. Our holistic curriculum and programmes nurture childrenâ€™s confidence,
social skills, bilingualism and build a good foundation in literacy and
numeracy.</p>
<p>Should you require a full-day service for your child, we also offer Kindergarten
Care (KCare) Services at all MKs. If you register, your child will be in
KCare Service after the MK session, providing a full-day programme for
your child within the same premises.</p>
<p>At the physical Open House 2025, parents are welcomed to tour the learning
environment and speak to the MK Educators in person. We warmly welcome
you and your child to sign up for the 2025 MOE Kindergarten Open House
on 15 February 2025 from 8.00am to 12.00pm, to find out why MK is the quality
preschool choice and how we ignite joy of learning in our children!</p>
