<p>South View Primary School Parents Association (SVPA) partners with the school to initiate and organise an exciting array of activities and events for parents and children. We stay united and committed to work with the school in bringing the best out of our child(ren).</p>
<p>1. Acting as a voice for parents</p>
<ul>
<li>SVPA allow parents to opt for greater involvement in the school activities than before. Parents now have a legitimate voice for giving constructive feedback to the school. This, in turn, creates a more positive relationship between parents and school and eliminates the possibility of misunderstandings. SVPA, provide a channel for parents to raise issues and concerns, seek clarification of decisions and resolve problems. It also enables the school to identify and respond to issues of interest to parents.</li>
</ul>
<p>2. Parents as resource</p>
<ul>
<li>Parental participation encourages other parents to join SVPA. Parent representatives are, therefore, better able to convince other parents to be involved in school, to work with them for the betterment of the school, than school personnel.</li>
</ul>
<p>3. Benefit to your child</p>
<ul>
<li>Student whose parents are involved in their education exhibit more positive attitudes and behaviour ;</li>

<ul>
<li>Create a home environment that encourages learning;</li>
