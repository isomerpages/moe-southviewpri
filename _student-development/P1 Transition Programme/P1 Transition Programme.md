<p>&ldquo;We Love, We Can, We Learn&rdquo; is a Primary 1 transition programme unique to South View Primary School.</p>
<p>By focusing on fostering children&rsquo;s social and emotional adjustment, this 4-week programme enables children to feel comfortable and familiar with the school environment and expectations. It involves families and recognises the important role families play in supporting children and staff to make school an exciting and engaging place. The school also focuses on identifying and bridging the differences between children&rsquo;s prior-to-school experiences, and supporting their overall development.</p>
<p>We envision that, through this programme, pupils love the school, their teachers and friends, can experience success and be competent as learners.</p>
<p>Event timeframe: First 4 weeks of school.</p>
