<p><strong>Message from Chairperson</strong></p>
<img style="width: 33%;" src="/images/esther.jpeg" align = "left">
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>Greetings! I am Esther Loh, current Chairperson of the South View Primary School Parents Association (SVPA). At the 17th AGM, my team and I were elected as the Exco committee for a two-year term. We are honoured and humbled to have an opportunity to serve our members and the school.</p>
<p>SVPA is a corporate body made up of caring and involved parents, who are united and committed to work with the school in bringing the best out of our child(ren). We have created an important link between the school, parents and pupils. We promote and encourage parental engagement and involvement in school. Our members come from diverse backgrounds, possess varied experiences, interests, expertise and knowledge. This rich diversity of talents and a wide network allow us to achieve our mission, benefiting the school and pupils.</p>
<p>SVPA seeks to form a strong and committed partnership with the school to work towards holistic development and welfare of the pupils. Currently, we have various sub-committees headed by EXCO members to plan and organise programmes and activities in collaboration with the school. Our programmes are strongly supported by parent volunteers from all levels and we hope to see even more parents stepping forth to contribute to a common cause.</p>
<p>As parents, you are a key influence of your child&rsquo;s character and values. I am sure you want the best for your child(ren) and help them get the most out of his/her school experience. This can be achieved through active involvement in school activities. Guiding your child through this exciting educational journey is a wonderful privilege that SVPA parents and educators share in South View Primary School.</p>
<p>Pre-pandemic, SVPA initiated and organised an array of physical activities and events for the school and our members. Post-pandemic, we have been trying out new ways that we can take part in to support the school and our members. We also look forward to exploring new opportunities that allow us to bond together with our members and your children.</p>
<p>We welcome you to join us in the programmes that we offer throughout the year by participating as parent volunteer and/or subcommittee members. Whatever level of participation you choose, your time and involvement is greatly appreciated and we hope you will find such experience enjoyable.</p>
<p>SVPA also aims to provide its members a channel for parents to raise issues and concerns, and provide constructive feedbacks to the school. If you have any concerns, please feel free to contact me or any of the EXCO members through the various channels available. On this note, do join us and rally together to achieve our vision and mission as well as building invaluable friendships.</p>
