<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has taught all of us that we cannot take our stability, unity and all that we have worked hard for as a nation, for granted. The pandemic has also heightened the need for all of us to cultivate an attitude of continual learning and improvement. This continual striving for improvement, or Growth Mindset, has been a key driver of Singapore&rsquo;s success. It is why we keep seeking ways to ensure Singapore remains relevant and competitive despite the volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous world we live in; and some of these ways will directly impact our students.</p>
<p>Changes have been made to assessment so that students have more time to find joy in learning. The PSLE and other examinations that students face may loom large and occupy a lot of their time, but they need to learn to view these as indicators of their progress rather than a measure of their value. The future does not depend on certificates or those who are discouraged by failure, but it belongs to those who can grow and continue to &lsquo;Learn for Life&rsquo;.</p>
<p>&lsquo;Learn for Life&rsquo; is a value, an attitude and a skill that our students would need to possess. Our students need to be resilient, adaptable and global in their outlook. They must feel curious and eager to learn as they pursue learning in their whole lifetime. Examination and grades are thus comparatively small milestones in the life journey of a child.</p>
<p>In 2021, the revised scoring system for the Primary School Leaving Examinations (PSLE) came into effect. This is a key step taken by the Ministry of Education (MOE) to reduce the impact created by fine differentiation of students at a young age. By providing students with Achievement Levels instead of T-scores, students will be encouraged to gauge their performance relative to the objectives of the curriculum as opposed to their peers. This will allow students to focus on themselves as learners and be more intrinsically motivated to seek out meaningful learning opportunities.</p>
<p>In South View Primary School (SVPS), we continually review our programmes and work towards enhancing the environment for the holistic development of our Southviens. In 2021, SVPS introduced these 7 Executive Functioning (EF) Superheroes to our students to teach them EF skills so that they could be future ready.</p>

<p>We seek your support and partnership in this journey. Join us in helping our Southviens learn to be organised, self-discover and self-monitor, have fun, bounce back from failures as they discover their interests and talents. Most importantly, never cease to believe in them as they navigate their way through the crests and troughs of school life.</p>
<p>We believe that with a Growth Mindset and having EF skills, our Southviens will be ready for life as SVPS also emphasises values education &ndash; Integrity, Care, Resilience, Respect and Responsibility. As we move into the year 2022, may I invite you, students as well as parents, to partner the school to nurture Southviens to be Passionate Learners with a Heart to Serve.</p>
