<p>Welcome back to a brand-new school year, filled with new beginnings, new
adventures and learning opportunities for Southviens. At South View, we
aspire to develop Passionate Learners with a Heart to Serve, through inspiring
their young minds, holding the space for their curiosity and moulding their
characters to be a gracious and humble future generation.</p>
<p>In this volatile world that we are living in today, we are facing many
challenges brought on by geopolitical shifts, revolutionising technology
and even climate changes. The future will bring many changes that we cannot
foresee today. However, we can embrace these challenges by making the most
of new opportunities and to do so, developing independence and fostering
a sense of agency in our young children is important.&nbsp;As our children
learn to complete tasks and make decisions without constant help and guidance
from trusted adults, they develop self-efficacy and confidence in their
abilities to learn, grow and contribute to others.&nbsp;As they are continually
motivated to positively influence their own lives and the world around
them, our children will grow to lead a meaningful and purposeful life,
which keeps them anchored in core values, regardless of the new realities
the future may bring.</p>
<p>In school, we will continue to incorporate opportunities for our Southviens
to demonstrate their student agency and independence through our daily
lived experiences and signature school programmes. We also value our Home-School
Partnership to raise a “Happy, Kind and Confident Generation Together”.
Let us maintain respectful communications between educators and parents,
role-model the skills and values our children need to learn and foster
real connections through building bonds to support the emotional and mental
wellbeing of our children.</p>
<p>In 2026, we celebrate our school’s 80<sup>th</sup> anniversary – “Celebrating
Memories, Creating Dreams”, a milestone that reflects decades of learning,
growth and character building as a community, from Nam San School and Ama
Keng School, and finally merging into South View Primary School in 1990.
To commemorate this very special occasion, we have refreshed several learning
spaces to showcase the school’s rich history and incorporated new elements
to enrich students’ learning experiences and also planned for a series
of celebrations aligned to our SV80 theme throughout the year. We warmly
invite all parents, alumni and community partners to join us in these celebrations,
as your support is integral to making this milestone a memorable and meaningful
one. More details will follow in our school notifications and school website,
and we look forward to celebrating with you!</p>
