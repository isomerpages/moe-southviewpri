<p>Through this CCA, pupil librarians get to learn and hone their public speaking skills which include clear articulation, engagement and appropriate body gestures. By developing these skills, our pupil librarians will have the confidence to speak well while doing their book-talks to their peers in school as well as visitors to the library.</p>
<p>Pupil librarians have a chance to showcase what they have learnt during library activities such as book promotions. They will also design and promote the habit of reading as well as good reads to their peers to be inspired. Part of the ICT skills they will hone include the use of PowerPoint slides for presentation. They will also work on script-writing skills to promote their activities during pre-assembly slots. Pupil librarians will also have the opportunity to take part in external competitions such as the National Literacy Quiz organised by National Library Board where they pit their literary world knowledge against pupils from both other schools. Such platforms and exposure will help develop their public speaking skills and boost their confidence.</p>
