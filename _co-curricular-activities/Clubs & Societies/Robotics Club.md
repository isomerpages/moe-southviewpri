<p>In Robotics Club, we have creative, inquisitive and passionate young people who have desire to learn the latest development of robotics technology which will benefit the environment and mankind. Students are given the opportunity to express their creativity, logical reasoning and problem-solving skills. As students work in teams to build and program to solve missions and problems, they develop 21st century competencies such as critical and inventive thinking, communicating ideas clearly and effectively. The National Robotics Competition, LEGO EV3 Mindstorms and Scratch programming are a few of the many platforms to hone their skills.</p>
