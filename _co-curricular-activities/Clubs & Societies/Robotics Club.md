<p>In the Robotics Club, our creative, inquisitive and passionate young innovators
are driven by a desire to explore the latest advancements in robotics technology
that contribute positively to the environment and humankind.</p>
<p>Students are provided with opportunities to express their creativity,
apply logical reasoning, and enhance their problem-solving abilities. Through
team-based projects, they design, build and programme robots to accomplish
various missions, developing key 21st-Century Competencies such as critical
and inventive thinking, as well as effective communication. Platforms such
as LEGO Spike Prime and Scratch programming enable them to hone their technical
and collaborative skills, while our Primary 5 and 6 members also use Micro:bit
in their VIA projects to design purposeful task to engage the young learners.</p>
<p>Each year, our Primary 5 students proudly represent the school at the
National Robotics Competition, demonstrating innovation and teamwork in
action.</p>
<p>The Robotics Club embodies the spirit of young innovators — building the
future, one robot at a time.</p>
