<p>“Skill in photography is acquired by practice and not by purchase.” .~ Percy W. Harris</p>
<p>People often say that your first 1000 photographs are your worst and since photography is synonymous with Media@SV, this CCA is one good way to build resilience and patience among the students since all our members will be introduced to the camera upon joining our CCA. There, they learn skills on how to compose their photographs and capture good shots.</p>
<p>Besides joining local and internationally-acclaimed competitions, members will have the chance to support the school and put what they learnt into practice during school events such as Chinese New Year, National Day and Teachers’ Day celebrations. Apart from photography, members are given hands-on experience in video-taking and using video editing software to produce their own videos. We hope to instill in students a heart to serve the school with their skills and knowledge in photography and videography.</p>
