<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p><em>Media Resource Library: Where Stories Come Alive</em>
</p>
<p>In our dynamic Library &amp; Media Club, students discover the powerful
synergy between storytelling and visual communication. This unique CCA
transforms enthusiastic beginners into confident communicators who can
both craft compelling narratives and capture them through stunning visuals.</p>
<p>Our pupil librarians develop public speaking skills through engaging book-talks,
creative presentation design, and script writing for school assemblies.
They inspire reading habits among peers while building confidence. Meanwhile,
Media Club members embrace the philosophy that "skill in photography is
acquired by practice and not by purchase," mastering composition, lighting,
and video production through hands-on experience.</p>
<p>The magic happens when these two groups collaborate during major school
events, commemorations and festivities—where librarians create engaging
content while media members capture these precious moments. Students participate
in local and international competitions, building resilience and technical
expertise along the way.</p>
<p>Through real-world applications and service to the school community, our
members graduate as well-rounded leaders equipped with presentation skills,
technical expertise, and creative vision. They learn that every story matters,
every image speaks, and every student has a unique voice worth sharing.</p>
