<p>In Environmental Science Club, students discover scientific knowledge and concepts through many interesting activities. The aim is to promote their understanding for the environment and to make discoveries through inquiry activities. Students can develop their understanding of environmental issues, conservation and sustainable living while instilling a sense of responsibility and respect for the environment. CCA members gain experience from each other in fun and engaging through fun experiments and participation in learning journeys. Through these activities and interaction, we aim to provide the platform for building personal character and fostering interpersonal skills and strengthen the creative and innovative spirit, as well as promote an appreciation for Science.</p>
