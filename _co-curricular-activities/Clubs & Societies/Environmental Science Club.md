<p>In Environmental Science Club, students discover scientific knowledge and concepts through many interesting activities. The aim is to promote their understanding for the environment and to make discoveries through inquiry activities. Students can develop their understanding of environmental issues, conservation and sustainable living while instilling a sense of responsibility and respect for the environment.
