<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>In Environmental Science Club, students discover scientific knowledge
and concepts through many interesting activities. The aim is to promote
their understanding for the environment and to make discoveries through
inquiry activities. Students can develop their understanding of environmental
issues, conservation and sustainable living while instilling a sense of
responsibility and respect for the environment. CCA members gain experience
from each other in fun and engaging through fun experiments and participation
in learning journeys. Through these activities and interaction, we aim
to provide the platform for building personal character and fostering interpersonal
skills and strengthen the creative and innovative spirit, as well as promote
an appreciation for Science.</p>
