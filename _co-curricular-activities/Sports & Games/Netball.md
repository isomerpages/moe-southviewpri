<p>The SV Netball girls are actively involved in this sport through the extensive learning of movement skills such as passes, footwork and spatial awareness. This will enable them to have speed, agility and good ball handling skills. Through the training sessions, we aim to nurture interest about the game and in the process reinforcing social-emotional competencies such as self-awareness, relationship management and responsible decision-making and the school values such as  Integrity, Care, Respect, Resilience and Responsibility. The girls will have the opportunity to play in many intra-games within their sparring buddies and have the opportunity to represent the school to participate in netball carnivals and in the annual zonal competition.</p>
