<p>Our SV Badminton members develop their passion and interests in Badminton through honing their skills and techniques of game play. Experienced members undertake additional responsibilities in guiding and assisting their juniors during training sessions. Our players of the Senior and Junior Divisions have the opportunity to participate in the Inter-Primary Schools Badminton Championship and other external competitions to bring their badminton skills to a higher level. In addition, members are provided with opportunities to work as a team, forge new friendships and thus, instill a sense of belonging in the CCA. Apart from working towards excellence in skills, members are also guided towards developing positive character traits and values.</p>
