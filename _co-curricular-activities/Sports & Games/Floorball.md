<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>The Floorball CCA aims to develop students' basic skills including dribbling
and passing, along with learning game knowledge that enables students to
enjoy the sport while enhancing their floorball skill abilities and physical
fitness for sporting achievement.</p>
<p>The trainings also contribute to character development of students through
cultivating mental resilience, self-discipline, collaborative skills and
good sportsmanship. Additionally, Floorball CCA provides students with
leadership development opportunities through peer coaching roles, allowing
students to guide their group members in improving skills and techniques
during team training sessions.</p>
<p><strong>Main Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Students are divided into two teams, Junior (Primary 4 and 5) and Senior
(Primary 6).</p>
