<p>Floorball was formerly covered in Multi-sports CCA. Due to the high interest in this sport, it was introduced as a CCA in 2021. Floorball is a fun and fast-paced sport played indoors with floorball sticks and a ball. The sport is easy to pick up with simple rules that one can easily learn in a matter of minutes. Whilst the sport has similarities to ice hockey and hockey, field players do not require protective gears as the sport is relatively safe with rules against pushing, high stick etc. Floorball helps to improve studentsâ€™ athletic, speed, reaction and elasticity skills as well as hand-eye coordination and stick-handling abilities.</p>
