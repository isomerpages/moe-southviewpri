<p>Multi-sports CCA aims to expose students to various sports such as track &amp; field, volleyball and basketball. As such, students will gain a broader experience in the various sports. Moreover, students will also be given opportunities to engage in friendly games with students from other schools, providing a platform for social interaction and building sportsmanship. Intra-games and competitions are organized to allow students to participate in a competitive yet learning experience.</p>
