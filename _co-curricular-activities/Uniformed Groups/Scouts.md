<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>In South View Primary School, our Cub Scouts are equipped with outdoor
survival skills such as rope tying and outdoor cooking. They also contribute
back to society by planning and participating in VIA activities, as well
as yearly Scout activities such as Job Week and Donation Draw. Our Cub
Scouts are nurtured to become disciplined individuals who have camaraderie
with each other. Through various activities conducted during weekly sessions
and camps, our Cub Scouts are given the opportunity to develop their physical
fitness, interpersonal skills and confidence.</p>
<p><strong>Main Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Activities are carried out in Sixes. This encourages Cubs to take ownership
of themselves and grow through peer-led learning. Pack meetings are opportunities
for adventures, learning life skills, hikes, outdoor cooking, camps, games,
shelter-building, knotting, craftwork, and other Scouting skills – all
while making new friends.</p>
<p>As the 1st line of the Scout Promise reads, “I promise to do my best!”
– so every boy and girl Cub will endeavour to overcome difficulties, setbacks
and challenges, to do their very best in all things and at all times.</p>
<p>Cubs will earn badges as they go through the Cub Scout programme – namely
in Scouting skills (Progress badges), personal skills (Proficiency badges),
as well as commemorative badges for key area events (such as campfires,
hikes, or Founders Day celebrations). Hence, they have the opportunity
to interact beyond their pack.</p>
