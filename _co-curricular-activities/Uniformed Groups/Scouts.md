<p>In South View Primary School, our Cub Scouts are equipped with outdoor survival skills such as rope tying and outdoor cooking. They also contribute back to society by planning and participating in VIA activities, as well as yearly Scout activities such as Job Week and Donation Draw.</p>
<p>Our Cub Scouts are nurtured to become disciplined individuals who have camaraderie with each other. Through various activities conducted during weekly sessions and camps, our Cub Scouts are given the opportunity to develop their physical fitness, interpersonal skills and confidence.</p>
