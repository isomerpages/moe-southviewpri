<p>The Girls’ Brigade Singapore’s mission is to develop each Girl and Officer to her fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling where every Girl will become a Leader and every officer a Servant Leader.</p>
<p>In line with this mission, we seek to provide a community where the Girls can discover their strengths and purpose in life and to develop their skills and character. CCA sessions include Character-Building lessons, different badge work, drills and bonding activities with their peers, teachers and officers. In addition to these, there are also VIA sessions where the Girls get to interact with and serve the elderly in the neighbourhood. The Girls can also look forward to combined camps with other schools where they get to interact with and build friendships beyond their own school. As one Girl aptly puts it, “We get to sing, do craft, play sports… Why not just join one CCA that has everything?”</p>
<p>Yet, beyond the myriad of activities, we seek, above all, to develop Servant Leaders who, having received so much, would go on to give back. Hence, Girls who have graduated can choose to contribute to the CCA by serving as Anchors where they will be given opportunities to guide, train and mentor the younger ones.</p>
