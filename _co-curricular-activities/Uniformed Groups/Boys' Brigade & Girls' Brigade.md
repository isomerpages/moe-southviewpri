<p>The Boys' &amp; Girls’ Brigade mission is to develop each Boy / Girl and Officer to their fullest potential by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling where every student will become a Leader and every officer a Servant Leader.</p>
<p>In line with this mission, we seek to provide a community where the students can discover their strengths and purpose in life and to develop their skills and character. CCA sessions include Character-Building lessons, different badge work, drills and bonding activities with their peers, teachers and officers. In addition, there are VIA sessions where the students would be able to interact with and serve the elderly in the neighbourhood. The students can also look forward to combined camps with other schools where they will have the opportunity to interact with and build friendships beyond their own school. As one student aptly puts it, “We get to sing, do craft, play sports… Why not just join one CCA that has everything?”</p>
<p>Yet, beyond the myriad of activities, we seek, above all, to develop Servant Leaders who, having received so much, would go on to give back. Hence, Boys and Girls who have graduated can choose to contribute to the CCA by serving as Anchors where they will be given opportunities to guide, train and mentor the younger ones.</p>
