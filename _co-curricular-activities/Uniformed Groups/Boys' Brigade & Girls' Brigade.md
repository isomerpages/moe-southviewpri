<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>The Boys' Brigade mission is to develop each Boy to their fullest potential
by Equipping, Empowering and Enabling where every student will become a
Leader and every officer a Servant Leader.</p>
<p>In line with this mission, we seek to provide a community where the students
can discover their strengths and purpose in life and develop their skills
and character. CCA sessions include Character-Building lessons, different
badge work, drills and bonding activities with their peers, teachers and
officers. In addition, there are VIA sessions where the students would
be able to interact with and serve the elderly in the neighbourhood. The
students can also look forward to combined camps with other schools where
they will have the opportunity to interact with and build friendships beyond
their own school. As one student aptly puts it, “We get to sing, do craft,
play sports… Why not just join one CCA that has everything?”</p>
<p>Yet, beyond the myriad of activities, we seek, above all, to develop Servant
Leaders who, having received so much, would go on to give back. Hence,
Boys who have graduated can choose to contribute to the CCA by serving
as Anchors where they will be given opportunities to guide, train and mentor
the younger ones.</p>
