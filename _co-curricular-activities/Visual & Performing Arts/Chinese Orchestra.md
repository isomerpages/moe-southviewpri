<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>The South View Chinese Orchestra aims to nurture pupils’ appreciation
for traditional Chinese music and culture while developing their musicality,
discipline, and teamwork. Through learning and performing on a variety
of traditional instruments, pupils build perseverance, confidence, and
collaboration skills. The CCA also seeks to cultivate character and leadership
by providing opportunities for pupils to perform, serve, and contribute
meaningfully to the school and community through music.</p>
<p><strong>Main Activities</strong>
</p>
<p>Members of the Chinese Orchestra participate in weekly sectional and ensemble
practices, focusing on both foundational techniques and group performance
skills. Throughout the year, pupils prepare for school events such as the
Chinese New Year concert, VIA performances, and major arts showcases including
the Singapore Youth Festival (SYF) Arts Presentation. They also take part
in internal performances, enrichment workshops, and peer-led mentoring
sessions where senior members guide juniors in learning new pieces. These
activities allow pupils to grow as confident performers and dedicated team
players.</p>
