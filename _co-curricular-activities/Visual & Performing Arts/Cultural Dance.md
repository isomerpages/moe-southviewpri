<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>Cultural dance is a form of expression that reflects the traditions, beliefs,

style is unique and is often performed during school celebrations, and
community events. Learning about cultural dance helps students appreciate
diversity and understand the values of different cultures. It encourages
respect, curiosity, and open-mindedness. Dancing can also be a fun way
to stay active, build teamwork, and boost confidence!</p>
