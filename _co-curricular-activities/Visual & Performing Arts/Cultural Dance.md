<p>At SV Cultural Dance, students will be given the opportunity to explore and fulfill their passion in dance. They will have cross-cultural dance experiences through exploration of various dance genres including Chinese Dance, Indian Dance, Malay Dance and Fusion Dance. They will also be provided with opportunities to hone their creativity by having opportunities to contribute ideas and share in the creative process of choreography.</p>
<p>SV Cultural Dance actively participate in many performances such as Singapore Youth Festival (SYF), Open Call, SVâ€™s biennial Arts Showcase, internal and external events/competitions. Through these opportunities, students work towards a common goal of attaining excellence, values and forming bonds by inculcating a growth mindset that will continue in all aspects of their life. Students also develop life skills and the ability to lead and be led to take on different roles in a team.</p>
