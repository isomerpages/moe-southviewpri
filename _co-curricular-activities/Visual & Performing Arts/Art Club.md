<p><strong>Objectives</strong>
</p>
<p>The Art Club provides a platform for Southviens to explore and develop
their artistic skills through engaging art making activities. They will
be immersed in the joy of art making and creative processes in a collaborative
environment. Through exposure to art making tools and mediums, they hone
their artistic competency and cultivate the love and appreciation of visual
arts. Via authentic tasks and activities, Southviens inculcate team spirit,
ownership and a sense of belonging to the school. Their participation in
the SYF exhibition, museum learning journey and community involvement programmes
also serves to enrich and broaden their experience.</p>
