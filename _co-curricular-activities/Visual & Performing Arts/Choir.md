<p>In SV Nightingales, our choristers aspire to become confident singers and performers. They are exposed to a wide repertoire ranging from classical to contemporary music. Through music, our choristers learn to enjoy and appreciate music from different cultures.</p>
<p>Our SV Nightingales also participated in many performances such as the National Day Parade and our biennial  Arts Showcase. Together with our dedicated teachers and experienced conductor, the CCA provides training in vocal techniques and voice production for any child who has an interest in singing. Through the weekly interactions, students learn to build their self-esteem and resilience while improving their social skills as they get to work as a band of brothers and sisters.</p>
