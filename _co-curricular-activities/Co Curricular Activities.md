<h4><strong>Purpose</strong></h4>
<p>Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs) are an integral part to a child’s holistic education. Through CCA, students discover their interests and talents while developing values and competencies that will prepare them for a rapidly changing world. CCA also promotes friendships among students from diverse backgrounds as they learn, play and grow together. Participation in CCA fosters social integration and deepens students’ sense of belonging, commitment and sense of responsibility to the school, community and nation.</p>
<h4><strong>Overview</strong></h4>
<p>In South View Primary School, we want to ensure that every student is given an opportunity to achieve his/her personal best. Being part of a CCA is one of the platforms which the students can do so. All students, from Primary 4 onwards are strongly encouraged to participate in one CCA, from one of the four domains – Sports &amp; Games, Uniformed Groups, Visual or Performing Arts, or Clubs &amp; Societies.</p>
