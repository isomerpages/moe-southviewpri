<p>SA@SV is grounded in James Anderson's conceptualisation of Learner Agency,
which defines it as the degree to which individuals can meaningfully influence
their world, particularly when confronted with challenges. This foundational
framework guides our approach to empowering students as active agents in
their learning journey.</p>
<p>James Anderson further elaborated on three interrelated and equally important
elements:&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Will to Act, and</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The Power to Act</p>
</li>
</ul>
