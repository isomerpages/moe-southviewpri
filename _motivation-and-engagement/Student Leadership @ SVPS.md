<p>As part of SVPS’s Student Leadership efforts, we are committed to:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Developing Southviens in the area of Self-Leadership by empowering them
to cultivate self-mastery and personal effectiveness. This is achieved
through platforms such as the CCE Curriculum, Form Teacher Guidance Period
(FTGP), Co-Curricular Activities (CCAs), and Programme for Active Learning
(PAL), forming the foundation of our <em>Tier 1</em> leadership development.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Nurturing student leaders in formal leadership roles (<em>Tiers 2 and 3</em>)
through structured weekly training which focused on:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Fostering self and social awareness of their roles and responsibilities
within the school and the wider community.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Equipping student leaders with the knowledge, skills, values, and competencies
necessary to lead effectively and serve others.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Creating meaningful opportunities for student leaders to contribute and
make a positive impact on the school and community.</p>
</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p><strong>&nbsp;Kouzes’ &amp; Posner’s Leadership Challenge Model (LCM)</strong>
</p>
<p>At SVPS, our Student Leadership programme is guided by Kouzes and Posner’s
Leadership Challenge Model (LCM). Through this model, students cultivate
leadership skills by actively engaging in the Five Practices of Exemplary
Leadership:</p>

<p>(Adapted from Kouzes &amp; Posner’s Leadership Challenge Model)</p>
<p>These five practices form the foundation of our leadership training. Explicit
instruction on each practice is delivered during weekly structured leadership
sessions. In addition, leadership and service opportunities for student
leaders are purposefully aligned with these practices to support the development
of exemplary leadership behaviours.</p>
