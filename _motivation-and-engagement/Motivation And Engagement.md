<p><em>“</em><strong><em>How do we help our children succeed in life?</em></strong>
</p>
<p><em>“Not by sending them to more tuition or enrichment classes, but by <u>developing them holistically and empowering them</u> to learn deeply, helping them to be confident about their strengths and interests, anchoring them in values, and developing them in the <u>adaptability, resilience, and determination</u> to thrive in a world of change.”</em>
</p>
<p><em>Minister Desmond Lee</em>
</p>
<p><em>Speech for the Debate on the President’s Address, 25 Sept 2025</em>
</p>
<p>&nbsp;The Motivation and Engagement Department aims to promote stronger
student agency, empowering students to be motivated and engaged to take
greater ownership of their learning.
<br>We aspire for our students to become:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p><strong>Self-directed learners&nbsp;</strong>who take responsibility for
their own learning, demonstrating curiosity, reflection, and perseverance
in the lifelong pursuit of learning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Confident persons&nbsp;</strong>who think independently and critically</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Active contributors&nbsp;</strong>who exercise initiative and
have the courage to take&nbsp;risks responsibly</p>
</li>
</ul>
