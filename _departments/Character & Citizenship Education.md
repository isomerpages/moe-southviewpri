<p><strong>Character and Citizenship Department</strong></p>
<p>The Character &amp; Citizenship Education (CCE) Department aims to inculcate values and build social emotional competencies in students to develop them to be good individuals and useful citizens. Our students have the opportunities to participate in various CCE lessons and programmes and equip themselves with the knowledge and skills required to make sense of their own identities, form positive relationships with others and learn to make good choices.</p>

Our structured CCE Form Teacher Guidance Period (CCE FTGP) curriculum equips students with social emotional competencies and school values and provide quality interaction time between form teachers and students in a safe and positive learning environment.</li><br>

CCE lessons are taught in Mother Tongue languages (MTL). For students who take the non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL) as their Mother Tongue and for those exempted from taking MTL, CCE will be taught in English.
CCE MT teachers use cultural stories, songs, idioms, and proverbs unique to each Mother Tongue Language to teach moral values and perspective taking.</li><p></p>

	<p>The four NE Commemorative Days (Total Defence Day, International Friendship Day, Racial Harmony Day, and National Day) are an important part of students’ learning experiences on being active citizens in school and nation. Through these NE commemorative days, students learn important lessons from significant moments in Singapore history, understand the importance of our nation’s friendship ties with other countries, and reflect on they can apply their learning and contribute as active citizens.</p>
	<p><b>P3 National Education (NE) Learning Journey</b></p>
	<p>The P3 students went on a farm tour at Kok Fah Technology Farm. During the tour, they got an idea of what vertical farming was and its benefits. They were also introduced to the variety of produce that the farm harvest for local consumption. 
This trip aims to provide opportunities for the students to understand the limited land use in Singapore and how it manages its resources to meet the needs of the country in future. It also encourages all students to reflect on and improve their daily practices so that they can play their part for the environment.</p>
