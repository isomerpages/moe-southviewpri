<p><strong><u>Applied Learning Programme &ndash; Project Work<br /></u></strong>ALP provides meaningful and purposeful age-appropriate opportunities for real-life application of learning. It allows for experimentation, self-discovery and joy of learning. The school has designed its own Project Work Programme. The programme spans across six levels. The programme aims to:<br />&bull; allow each student to see the applicative use of subjects<br />&bull; imbibe values through experiential learning<br />&bull; develop students&rsquo; Social Emotional competencies and 21CC skills<br />&bull; promote creativity and innovation&nbsp;<br />&bull; promote Self-directed Learning (SDL) and Collaborative Learning (CoL)</p>
<p><strong><u>Project Work in South View Primary School<br /></u></strong>The title for our school&rsquo;s Project Work is Sustaining Gaia. Students from Primary 1 to 6 will learn about the different environmental issues. They will collaborate with their peers to conduct research. During this process, students learn to work together to clarify the task, plan their work and take on their share of responsibilities. They record their ideas and reflections in written form. Thereafter, students will have the opportunity to present their findings to their teachers and peers using new media technology.<br />The table below summarizes the topics for the different level.</p>
