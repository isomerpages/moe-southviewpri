<p>The <strong>Programme for Active Learning</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>PAL</strong>&nbsp;is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 pupils. PAL off&shy;ers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful. PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in our pupils such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others. The programme encourages pupils to have a lively curiosity about the world they live in and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.</p>
