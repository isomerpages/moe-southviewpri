<p>The <strong>Programme for Active Learning</strong>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<strong>PAL</strong>&nbsp;is an integral part of the curriculum for Primary 1 and 2 pupils. PAL off&shy;ers learning experiences that are active, hands-on and meaningful. PAL contributes to the development of soft skills in our pupils such as the ability to communicate clearly and cooperate with others. The programme encourages pupils to have a lively curiosity about the world they live in and a belief in their ability to accomplish a task or deal with a challenge.</p>

<p><strong><u>Objectives of PAL@SV</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>PAL@SV&nbsp;</strong>aims for pupils to:</p>
<p>a) Acquire the necessary social and emotional competencies</p>
<p>The skills taught in PAL will help our young Southviens to better understand themselves as it helps build our pupils&rsquo; emotional literacy as they are able to express clearly how they feel. Our lessons expose our young Southviens to different scenarios in which they will learn how to manage their emotions and resolve conflicts.</p>
<p>b) Facilitate holistic and well-rounded development</p>
<p>The aim of PAL integrated into our curriculum is to provide a more balanced curriculum that facilitates well-rounded development of our pupils. This is in line with the school&rsquo;s mission, &ldquo;Inspiring minds, Moulding Character&rdquo; where we offer a balance between the academic and non-academic areas in the school.</p>
<p>c) PAL broadens the learning experiences of our children</p>
<p>The lessons aim to open up our pupils&rsquo; access to decision making and positively influences their future experiences. When Southviens are presented with challenges in their life, pupils will be able to make good decisions and have the skills to manage their emotions and be able to act appropriately.</p>
<p><u><strong>Overview of Lessons</strong></u></p>
