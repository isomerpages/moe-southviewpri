<p>The Curriculum, Innovation and Educational Technology (CIET) Department
aims to enhance the learning experiences in school through a learner-centred
approach and the use of technology.</p>
<p>We work closely with the different stakeholders to empower students and
prepare them for the future by supporting the use of technology:</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>For active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective
classroom to nurture the future-ready learner.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To design a range of learning experiences for students to develop the
knowledge, skills and dispositions of future-ready learners.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To develop future-ready learners who possess MOE 21st century competencies
and digital literacies.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>To ensure learning continues seamlessly in different learning contexts
(physical or digital)</p>
</li>
</ul>
