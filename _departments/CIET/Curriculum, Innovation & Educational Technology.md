<p>The Curriculum, Innovation and Educational Technology (CIET) Department aims to enhance the learning experience in school through a learner-centred approach and the use of technology to empower students and prepare them for the future. </p>

<p>We value student autonomy, critical thinking and collaboration and work closely with the different stakeholders to support the use of technology:</p>


<li>For active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner.</li>
<li>To design a range of learning experiences for students to develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions of future-ready learners.</li>
<li>To develop future-ready learners who possess MOE 21st century competencies and digital literacies.</li>
<li>To ensure learning continues seamlessly in different learning contexts (physical or digital)</li>
