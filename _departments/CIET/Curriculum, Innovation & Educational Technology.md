<p>The Curriculum, Innovation and Educational Technology (CIET) Department aims to enhance the learning experiences in school through a learner-centred approach and the use of technology.</p>

<p>We work closely with the different stakeholders to empower students and prepare them for the future by supporting the use of technology:</p>


* For active learning that creates a participatory, connected and reflective classroom to nurture the future-ready learner.
* To design a range of learning experiences for students to develop the knowledge, skills and dispositions of future-ready learners.
* To develop future-ready learners who possess MOE 21st century competencies and digital literacies.
* To ensure learning continues seamlessly in different learning contexts (physical or digital)
