<p>VIA in CCA are learning experiences that support pupils&rsquo; development as socially responsible citizens who can contribute meaningfully to the community, through the learning and application of values, knowledge and skills. Through the 3-year VIA in CCA programmes, targeted at the P4-P6 CCA members, the school hopes to provides opportunities for pupils to serve, relate and work with people beyond the school context and empathise with the elderly and people around them. This is carried out as part of pupils&rsquo; CCA activities.</p>
