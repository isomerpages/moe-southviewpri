<p>The Welcome Back to School programme is a unique programme dedicated to the first five days of school, to ensure a smoother transition for the pupils starting the new academic year, through meaningful lessons and activities. This programme aims to motivate &amp; boost pupils&rsquo; self-confidence and help them to build good relationships among peers and their teachers. It also helps to foster a sense of belonging to the school and strongly anchor the school values in the pupils. Pupils go through a rich transition experience where they are equipped with knowledge and skills to manage emotions and behaviour, build relationships and have the confidence to take on new challenges with a growth mindset.</p>
