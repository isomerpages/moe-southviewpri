<p><strong><u>Our Special Programmes</u></strong></p>
<p><u>Student Leadership</u></p>
<img style="width: 65%;" src="/images/PW3.jpg" />
<p>The Student Leadership CCA is part of our schools&rsquo; efforts to nurture student leaders who&nbsp;<strong>lead by example</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>communicate with confidence</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>serve with humility</strong>. Prefects, CCA Leaders and Cyber Wellness Ambassadors are enrolled into the CCA so that formal training and systematic planning and organisation of events by the student leaders can be carried out. The training takes place every Friday, 2p.m. to 4 p.m.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Regular and structured training provided through the CCA will help in meeting the following aims of our SVPS Student Leadership:</p>
<ul>
<li>To instil a sense of self and social awareness of student leaders' roles and responsibilities in the school and community</li>
<li>To equip student leaders with knowledge, skills and values, to develop their competence to lead and serve others</li>
<li>To provide opportunities for student leaders to serve and make a difference in the school and community</li>
</ul>
