<p>During the course of your child's/ward's time in our school, photographs, and/or recordings of you or your child/ward may be captured during our various school events, programmes or activities. These photographs and/or recordings are invaluable to our school's effort to make teaching and learning more effective and for publicity purposes. Some of these materials will be shared with all our stakeholders as they help to showcase our school's vibrant learning environment and share our Southviens' journey. The photographs and/or recordings may be published on our school website, publications, social media channels and other communication modes. Do inform us via letter or email&nbsp;<strong><em><u>if you do not wish</u></em></strong>&nbsp;for any photographs and/or recordings of you or your child/ward to be used.</p>
