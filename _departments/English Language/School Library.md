<p>Students visit the school library to read and borrow books from a variety of genres. There are reference books they can refer to, as well as monthly magazines and periodicals that they can read. There are monthly library programmes and book displays to encourage the students to read from a variety of genres and topics. Currently, the pupils can read and find out more about space and science fiction, and take part in a quiz to win tokens.</p>
<p>Designated as one of the recess play areas, classes are rostered every week to visit the library during their recess. Teachers can also book slots to bring their students to the library, to allow them to read and borrow books, or to use the space for their lessons. The library also houses the SV Star Studio that teachers can book to allow the students to use the props and costumes for role-play or story-telling.</p>
<p>To encourage students to borrow books, the library has launched a Read and Redeem programme where students get stamps on reward cards for books borrowed and get tokens for submitting completed cards and book reviews.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The school librarian has also looked through and updated the class library book collection to ensure it is age-appropriate and encourages our students to read widely.</p>
