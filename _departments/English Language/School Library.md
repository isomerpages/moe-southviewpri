<p>Students visit the school library to read and borrow books from a variety of genres. There are reference books they can refer to, as well as monthly magazines and periodicals that they can read. Monthly book displays and library activities created by the school librarian and library CCA members encourage Southviens to read from a variety of genres and topics. Through physical and online activities, the pupils can read and find out more from the range of books. From non-fiction books to works by local authors, students can take part in activities to win tokens.</p>

<p>The library provides a conducive and safe physical space for learning. Teachers can book slots to bring their students to the library, to allow them to read and borrow books, or to use the space for their lessons. The library also houses the SV Star Studio and stage area that teachers can utilise to allow the students to use the props and costumes for role play or storytelling. At the same time, the library is designated as one of the recess play areas, where students can visit during their recess.</p>

<p>To encourage students to borrow books, the library has launched a Read and Redeem programme where students get stamps on reward cards for books borrowed and receive tokens for submitting completed cards and book reviews.</p>

<p>The school librarian has also looked through and updated the class library book collection in each classroom to ensure it is age-appropriate and encourages our students to read widely even in class.</p>
