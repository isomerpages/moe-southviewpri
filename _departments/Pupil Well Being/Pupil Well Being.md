<p>The Pupil Well-Being Department aims to establish <strong>Quality Relationships</strong> and <strong>Positive School Experience</strong> for the students. Quality relationship entails positive Teacher-Student Relationship (TSR) & Student-Student Relationship (SSR). The school strengthens the quality of teacher-student and peer relationships to reinforce a <strong>Culture of Care</strong>, trust and respect so that students will form positive bonds and develop a strong sense of belonging to the school.</p>
<p><strong>Our Key Programmes</strong></p>
<p><strong>Peer Support Programme</strong><br />
Students contribute to the caring and positive peer culture in school when they look out for one another and provide support to their peers in need. With a peer support mind-set, students create a community of care and support amongst peers.</p>
<p>Under the Buddy System, all students have a class buddy. Besides helping their friends in school, they can motivate their friends to have a growth and resilient mindset. Peer Support Leaders (PSLs) were also appointed to look out for their peers and help them to seek support. The PSLs are involved in organising activities during Mental Health Awareness week.</p>

<p><strong>Student Leadership</strong><br />
The Student Leadership Programme is part of our schoolsâ€™ efforts to nurture student leaders who lead by example, communicate with confidence and serve with humility. Prefects, CCA Leaders and Peer Support Leaders are enrolled into the Programme so that formal training and systematic planning and organisation of events by the student leaders can be carried out.</p>
<p>The training takes place on selected Fridays, 2p.m. to 4 p.m. Regular and structured training provided will help in meeting the following aims of our SVPS Student Leadership:
<ul>
	<li>To instil a sense of self and social awareness of student leaders' roles and responsibilities in the school and community
<li>To equip student leaders with knowledge, skills and values, to develop their competence to lead and serve others
<li>To provide opportunities for student leaders to serve and make a difference in the school and community</ul></p>
