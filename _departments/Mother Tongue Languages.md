<p><strong>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department </strong>is dedicated to nurturing students in three key areas, laying a strong foundation for their growth and development:</p>
<p><strong><u>Communication</u></strong><br>
- By mastering the MTL, students acquire essential 21st Century Competencies for effective expression, building the groundwork for confident communication.<br><br>
<strong><u>Culture</u></strong><br>
	- Through immersive cultural experiences, students develop a strong sense of pride and appreciation for the MTL culture, an integral part of Singapore’s national identity.<br><br>
<strong><u>Connection</u></strong><br>
- By exploring their heritage, students strengthen their connections to their roots and build meaningful bridges to communities across Asia and the world.<br><br>
Beyond the national curriculum, our department offers a variety of programmes and competitions to ignite a love for their Mother Tongue languages and foster a deeper understanding of its cultural significance.</p><br>
<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong></p>
<h4>1. MTL Fortnight</h4>
<p> The MTL Fortnight provides students with opportunities to:<br>
</p><ul><li>Understand the cultural significance of themes that align with their developmental stage and language proficiency.</li>
<li>Apply theme-related vocabulary through engaging cultural activities.</li></ul><p></p><br>
<p><strong><u>Chinese Department</u></strong></p>
<p>Each year, themes such as "Traditional Games" or "Traditional Food" are brought to life through hands-on workshops, static displays, and interactive activities. These experiences build students' linguistic and cultural foundations while sparking curiosity and enjoyment.</p>
<p><strong><u>Malay Department</u></strong></p>
<p><strong>1. Hands-on Activities for Cultural Learning:</strong><br>
•	Through interactive, hands-on activities, students can immerse themselves in the Malay culture. Engaging in these activities helps students connect with the culture in a meaningful and enjoyable way, allowing them to see how traditions have evolved over time.</p>
<p><strong>2.	Connecting with Families:</strong><br>
•	The program encourages students to bring knowledge home, allowing them to converse with family members and share what they have learnt. This helps to bridge the gap between school and home, ensuring that cultural traditions are kept alive within families and across generations.</p>
<p><strong>3.	Performance-Based Activities:</strong><br>
•	Engaging in poetry recitals, skits, or role-playing activities encourages pupils to practice speaking Malay in a fun and confident manner. This informal setting removes the pressure of formal classroom learning and gives students the chance to experiment with the language.<br>
•	Students perform in groups or individually, which also promotes teamwork and peer motivation. Working with others encourages collaboration, helps build confidence, and makes the learning experience more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>4.	Building Confidence in Using the Language:</strong><br>
•	By participating in both cultural and language activities, students become more confident to use Spoken Malay in everyday conversations. They learn to speak with fluency and confidence in informal settings, which helps them transit to using the language in more formal situations.
