<p><strong>Mother Tongue Languages (MTL) Department </strong>is dedicated
to nurturing students in three key areas, laying a strong foundation for
their growth and development:</p>
<p><strong><u>Communication</u></strong>
<br>- By mastering the MTL, students acquire essential 21st Century Competencies
for effective expression, building the groundwork for confident communication.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Culture</u></strong>
<br>- Through immersive cultural experiences, students develop a strong sense
of pride and appreciation for the MTL culture, an integral part of Singapore’s
national identity.
<br>
<br><strong><u>Connection</u></strong>
<br>- By exploring their heritage, students strengthen their connections to
their roots and build meaningful bridges to communities across Asia and
the world.
<br>
<br>Beyond the national curriculum, our department offers a variety of programmes
and competitions to ignite a love for their Mother Tongue languages and
foster a deeper understanding of its cultural significance.</p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong>Key Programmes:</strong>
</p>
<h4>1. MTL Fortnight</h4>
<p>The MTL Fortnight provides students with opportunities to:
<br>
</p>
<ul data-tight="true" class="tight">
<li>
<p>Understand the cultural significance of themes that align with their developmental
stage and language proficiency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply theme-related vocabulary through engaging cultural activities.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<p>
<br>
</p>
<p><strong><u>Chinese Department</u></strong>
</p>
<p>Each year, themes such as "Traditional Games" or "Traditional Food" are
brought to life through hands-on workshops, static displays, and interactive
activities. These experiences build students' linguistic and cultural foundations
while sparking curiosity and enjoyment.</p>

<p><strong><u>Malay Department</u></strong>
</p>
<p><strong>1. Hands-on Activities for Cultural Learning:</strong>
<br>• Through interactive, hands-on activities, students can immerse themselves
in the Malay culture. Engaging in these activities helps students connect
with the culture in a meaningful and enjoyable way, allowing them to see
how traditions have evolved over time.</p>
<p><strong>2. Connecting with Families:</strong>
<br>• The program encourages students to bring knowledge home, allowing them
to converse with family members and share what they have learnt. This helps
to bridge the gap between school and home, ensuring that cultural traditions
are kept alive within families and across generations.</p>
<p><strong>3. Performance-Based Activities:</strong>
<br>• Engaging in poetry recitals, skits, or role-playing activities encourages
pupils to practice speaking Malay in a fun and confident manner. This informal
setting removes the pressure of formal classroom learning and gives students
the chance to experiment with the language.
<br>• Students perform in groups or individually, which also promotes teamwork
and peer motivation. Working with others encourages collaboration, helps
build confidence, and makes the learning experience more dynamic.</p>
<p><strong>4. Building Confidence in Using the Language:</strong>
<br>• By participating in both cultural and language activities, students
become more confident to use Spoken Malay in everyday conversations. They
learn to speak with fluency and confidence in informal settings, which
helps them transit to using the language in more formal situations.</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Thematic Based Approach</strong>
<br>As part of the cultural experience, students were introduced to thematic
based hands-on activities during the Mother Tongue Fortnight week. For
instance, they learnt about clay painting, using various colors to bring
about the joy of Deepavali celebrations. They also explored various dances
from the different states of India. In addition, they learnt about the
costumes and props used during this session.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing 21st CC Skills</strong>
<br>To inculcate 21st CC skills, P5 students tried Podcast by sharing their
views about contemporary issues. They brainstormed ideas in pairs and had
a dialogue session with their partner. This was a good opportunity for
them to apply their Spoken Interaction skills.</p>

<p><strong>Embracing Nature using Tamil Language</strong>
<br>Developing language skills can enhance one’s ability to express their
connection with nature, fostering a deeper appreciation and respect for
the environment. As such, our P2 students read a big book on conserving
trees, and they tried bark shading, followed by a discussion about the
different textures of tree bark. As part of exploring Indian spices, they
decorated photo frames with Indian spices such as star anise, cardamom
and cinnamon.</p>

<p><strong>Significance of Tamil Literature through Competitions</strong>
<br>Tamil epics and literature plays an important role in Tamil Language learning.
Due to modernization, our students tend to neglect the moral values and
culture that are prominent in Indian epics. Keeping this in mind, we encouraged
students to take part in role play competitions as part of our internal
competitions. This served as a good opportunity for them to research about
Thiruvalluvar and Mahakavi to prepare themselves for the competition.</p>
