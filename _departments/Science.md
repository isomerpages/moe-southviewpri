<p><strong>Our department vision: To develop passionate learners through the acquisition and application of scientific knowledge and skills.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our department belief: Joy of learning is purposeful and meaningful learning. This happens when a student understands the purpose of learning the subject and is able to make connection between what is learnt and how to connect and apply in real life.</strong></p>

<p>World of Wonder (WOW)-P1 and P2&nbsp;</p>
</td>
<td width="386">
<p>A sense of wonder is the essence of inquiry and nurturing this natural sense of wonder in children is key to the learning of Science. We begin this process in Primary 1, where the lessons in WOW stimulate their curiosity about themselves and their environment. WOW is conducted within curriculum time.</p>

<p>Science Plus-P3 to P6</p>
</td>
<td width="386">
<p>Science Plus aims to develop scientific attitudes, skills and habits of mind aligned to the desired 21st century competencies. We believe students need to experience real-world connections to make learning purposeful and meaningful. As such, Science Plus allows students to apply their understanding and to allow real-world connections by using real-world phenomena for science discussion. Through group discussion, pupils use science literacy to communicate ideas to make sense of information and build knowledge. The objective is to allow our students to think like scientists. P3 Science Plus is conducted within curriculum time while P4 to P6 are conducted as after-school programme for a term.</p>

<p>Authentic learning environments are provided for students to engage in self-directed learning while learning specific concepts taught in their respective levels. The school garden and solar-powered water sprinkler system are examples of learning resources used to support our students&rsquo; learning.</p>
<p>The school also conducts learning trails within the school and out of school for students to allow them to recognize and appreciate their interdependence and connectedness with their ecological worlds.&nbsp;</p>

<td>
<p>The department has embarked on the use of Google Classroom, Student Learning Space and other apps to leverage on the educational affordances these ICT platforms and tools provide. Teachers have also used ICT collaborative platforms like padlet and google slides to promote co-construction of knowledge. Interactive simulations like&nbsp;<a href="https://phet.colorado.edu/">https://phet.colorado.edu/</a>&nbsp;has been used to enhance and extend learning.</p>
<p>To promote self-directed learning, a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thinglink.com/video/1374927370401611777">video tour of our school garden</a>&nbsp;has been created to allow students to explore and discover.&nbsp;</p>
