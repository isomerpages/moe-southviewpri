<p>The Science department aims to develop students to be curious learners who have the knowledge and skills to make connection between themselves and the world around them.</p>
<p>We are preparing them to:</p>
<ul>
<li>develop skills, habits of mind and attitudes necessary for scientific inquiry&nbsp;</li>
<li>use using scientific knowledge and methods in making personal decisions&nbsp;</li>
<li>apply the knowledge they acquired to help them understand themselves and the world around them</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Our department belief</strong><br></u>Joy of learning is purposeful and meaningful learning. This happens when a student understands the purpose of learning the subject and is able to make connection between what is learnt and how to connect and apply in real life.</p>
