<td style="width: 391.594px;">
<p>Swimming is one of the key learning areas in the Physical Education syllabus and all primary schools leverage on the SwimSafer programme by SportSG to equip students with basic swimming and water survival skills.</p>
<p>SwimSafer 2.0 Programme aims to equip students with basic swimming and water survival skills, as well as to raise awareness of water safety and the standard of swimming proficiency.</p>
<p>Beyond teaching fundamental movement skills on land, students will also learn movement skills through water so as to open up new possibilities in aquatics. The water environment offers unique challenges to the students in managing their body posture in different spatial dimensions, emphasizing enjoyment during initial learning and ultimately enhancing their water movement competence, without losing focus on
water safety.</p>
