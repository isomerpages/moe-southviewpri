<p>The GastroChef Programme supports the development of emerging 21st Century
Competencies (e21CC), such as adaptive and inventive thinking, creativity
and collaboration. Through hands-on meal preparation, students learn essential
cooking skills and gain an appreciation for where food comes from, with
a focus on food sustainability. The programme also equips them with basic
food handling and hygiene knowledge and exposes them to a variety of cooking
methods. As they work together to create their dishes, students build independence,
teamwork, and a deeper appreciation for the culinary arts.</p>
