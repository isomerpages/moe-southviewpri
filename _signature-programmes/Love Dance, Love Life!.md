<p>"Love Dance. Love Life!" is our very own Learning for Life Programme in South View.</p>
<p>South View&rsquo;s approach to promote Music, Visual and Performing is borne out of its vision to be A School of Passionate Learners with A Heart to Serve.</p>
<p>The school wants to inspire students to initiate, innovate and explore new ideas to achieve excellence in all endeavours. The school&rsquo;s continuous effort in the provision of a broad-based and holistic learning is aligned to MOE&rsquo;s Holistic Education&nbsp;Framework with the aims to:</p>
<ul>
<li>promote creativity and innovation;</li>
<li>encourage students to pursue a passion and engage in self-directed and life-long learning;</li>
<li>evoke in students an appreciation of the cultural richness of our multi-cultural society and enhance a sense of identity and self-assurance in them;</li>
<li>nurture in our students qualities and values such as creativity, confidence, resilience and team-spirit - the competencies for living and working as adults in the 21st Century</li>
</ul>
<img style="width: 85%;" src="/images/ldll1.jpg" />
<p><strong>Approach<br /></strong>The school adopts a pyramid or ATP (All-Talent-Passion) approach in promoting Arts. By adopting the pyramid approach, the school aims to provide experience for all, identify and develop talents, and equip and inspire students to continue to pursue their passion and develop their talents beyond their primary education.</p>
<img style="width: 100%;" src="/images/ldll2.jpg" />
<p><strong>Approach 1 : Experience for All</strong></p>
<p>The experience for All is part of the school&rsquo;s effort in the provision of holistic and broad education to help every student explore and discover their talent. It is the first step towards the creation of different pathways to success. At this broad base level, all students learn dance, music and art through different modular programmes in the Art, Music and PHE (Dance) curriculum.</p>
<p>During the Level Enrichment Programme, which are also carried out during curriculum time, students are able to deepen their knowledge and skills acquired from the Art, Music and PHE (Dance) lessons and apply them to produce/perform a class dance with confidence. They also learn the history and culture of the different art forms, therefore to gain a better understanding of them and learn to appreciate different cultures.</p>

<p>The &ldquo;Experience for All&rdquo; at the base level is also an avenue for instructors and teachers to surface talented students.
