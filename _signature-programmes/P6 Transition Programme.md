<p>To prepare our P6 pupils for a smooth transition to secondary school, the school customised a transition programme for the pupils, aiming to equip them with life skills that will encourage self-awareness, self-directedness, independence and confidence. In addition, pupils would be able to adapt to changes and make responsible decisions.</p>
<p>Besides a school-based customised SEL curriculum, Project Work, local and overseas learning journeys and secondary school visits, pupils have the opportunity to engage and serve a wider community through their Values-In-Action in their ECG showcase.</p>
<p>The changes pupils face in secondary schools may be stressful to pupils and unnecessary strains should be kept to minimal while coping with the transition. With mindful planning, we believe that our pupils will be equipped with the essential skills and greater awareness through meaningful activities, thus, getting them Ready, To Secondary School, We Go!</p>
<p>Event timeframe: After PSLE to end of T4</p>
