<p><u>2. Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL)&nbsp;Classes from 2019</u>
</p>
<p>Non-Tamil Indian students are allowed to offer an approved non-Tamil Indian
Language (i.e. Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Panjabi or Urdu) in lieu of an
official Mother Tongue Language (MTL).&nbsp;Application is to be submitted
through the school for MOE’s approval.&nbsp;NTIL lessons are conducted
by the NTIL community groups on Saturday mornings at designated schools.
This is the link to access BTTSAL’s website (<a href="http://www.bttsal.com/index.php" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank"><u>http://www.bttsal.com/index.php</u></a>).
All NTIL students should attend lessons at these centres as they are able
to support the critical mass of NTIL learners needed to establish a richer
environment for language learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that South View Primary School will not be offering NTIL classes
for the 2019 P1 cohort onwards. If you have any queries, please do not
hesitate to contact the school.</p>
