<p>For more details on registration phases and procedures, please visit&nbsp;<a href="https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates"><u>https://www.moe.gov.sg/primary/p1-registration/registration-phases-key-dates</u></a>.</p>
<p><u>2. Non-Tamil Indian Languages (NTIL)&nbsp;Classes from 2019</u></p>
<p>Non-Tamil Indian students are allowed to offer an approved non-Tamil Indian Language (i.e. Bengali, Gujarati, Hindi, Panjabi or Urdu) in lieu of an official Mother Tongue Language (MTL).&nbsp;Application is to be submitted through the school for MOE’s approval.&nbsp;NTIL lessons are conducted by the NTIL community groups on Saturday mornings at designated schools. A list of these schools can be found on BTTSAL’s web site (<a href="http://www.bttsal.com/index.php/centres"><u>http://www.bttsal.com/index.php/centres</u></a>). All NTIL students should attend lessons at these centres as they are able to support the critical mass of NTIL learners needed to establish a richer environment for language learning.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Please note that South View Primary School will not be offering NTIL classes for the 2019 P1 cohort onwards. If you have any queries, please do not hesitate to contact the school.</p>
