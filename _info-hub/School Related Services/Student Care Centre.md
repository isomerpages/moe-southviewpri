<p>The school&rsquo;s school-based Student Care Centre (SCC), managed by Pro-Teach, seeks to provide an integral platform of support for students in the school who need a structured and supportive environment after school hours.</p>
<p>If you are keen to enrol your child in our SCC, please complete the Student Care Request Form&nbsp;by clicking this&nbsp;<a href="https://form.gov.sg/5fbb6621e9047c0012259340" target="_blank" rel="noopener">link</a>&nbsp;and the school will contact you.</p>
<p>Please note that as SCC vacancies are limited, the school will give priority to families who are more in need of after-school care arrangements.</p>
<p>If we are unable to enrol your child in our SCC, you may wish to consider an alternative community-based SCC near your home.&nbsp;You can search for other MSF-registered SCC by visiting the MSF website:&nbsp;<a href="https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://www.msf.gov.sg/dfcs/studentcare/default.aspx</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><u>About Pro-Teach</u></strong></p>
<p>Pro-Teach began operations in 1998, providing quality student care and education for children between the ages of 7 to 12 years old. We aim to provide children of South View Primary School with a diverse education in an environment that promotes self-discipline, character development and excellence in learning. We have 37 branches nationwide including 15 centres based in schools.</p>
<p>At Pro-Teach, we awaken possibilities through nurturing cognitive growth, emotional wisdom and physical wellness. We ensure that our students are constantly stimulated, interested and growing. Our students are provided with a curriculum that not only offers a breadth of academic experience across a variety of significant areas, it also incorporates social, physical, emotional and moral development as we believe these elements are integral to a holistic education.</p>
<p><strong><u>Pro-Teach Services &amp; Programmes</u></strong></p>
<p>In addition to close supervision of school homework and spelling training, we offer an exciting array of programmes specially designed for your child&rsquo;s holistic development. Halal-certified lunch and tea-break are provided during our school term programme.</p>
