Care Centre at South View Primary School, please apply to Singapore EduSmart
Learning Hub via the following link: <a href="https://forms.zohopublic.com/edusmartlearninghubsouthview/form/P1StudentCareRegistration2025/formperma/uIVHQ_7zHDBGfu9JI0nrKyS40egIa_kmguUtN2a0Zjo" rel="noopener nofollow" target="_blank">P1 2025 ROI</a> by <strong>30 October 2024 (Friday)</strong>.
Please note that as SSC vacancies are limited, the school will give priority
to families who are more in need of after-school care arrangements. The
school will evaluate your child's need for the SSC services and inform
you the outcome of your intent through our vendor, Singapore EduSmart Learning
Hub, <strong>by 8 November 2024</strong>.</p>
<p>If we are unable to enroll your child in our SSC, you may wish to consider
an alternative Community-based Student Care Centre. You can search for
other MSF-registered Student Care Centres by visiting the MSF website:
