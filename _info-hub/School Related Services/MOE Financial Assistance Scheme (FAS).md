<p><strong><u>MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (MOE FAS)</u></strong>
</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education (MOE) provides financial assistance to needy
Singaporean pupils in Government and Government-Aided schools. The application
for financial assistance for year 2026 is now open, and parents/guardians
may apply online at <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" target="_blank">https://go.gov.sg/moe-efasggas</a>.</p>
<p>Key enhancements and provisions have been introduced for the 2026 MOE
FAS applications to streamline the application process and better support
families.</p>
<p>MOE will integrate HOMES for means-testing from the 2026 application cycle.
Once parent/guardian applies for financial assistance via the link, the
system will automatically&nbsp;draw&nbsp;household income data from government
sources, removing the need for most applicants to submit supporting documents.</p>
<p>To expand access to financial assistance and provide better support to
families in need, the monthly gross household income ceiling for MOE FAS
will increase from $3,000 to $4,000, while the per capita income ceiling
will increase from $750 to $1,000. Students under MOE FAS will also benefit
from enhanced transport subsidies. The school bus subsidy for primary school
students will increase from 65% to 70% of the monthly fare, while the monthly
public transport subsidy for students taking public transport will increase
from $17 to $21.</p>
<p>The enhancements are in addition to existing subsidies that remain for
school fees, textbooks, uniforms and meals.</p>
