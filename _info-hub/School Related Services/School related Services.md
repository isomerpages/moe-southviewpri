<p><strong><u>Canteen<br></u></strong>In line with guidelines from MOE, the
canteen stalls in the school will be only be selling set meals with one
or two fixed items at a fixed price during recess and meal times. This
will help in reducing wait time as well as relief congestion at the stalls.
The menu for each stall please click&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-GiVM1M8VJ-4ZBRn8q45gjhqjHzPBS8h/view?usp=sharing" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Here"</a>

<p><strong><u>Temporary hold of the MOE Financial Assistance Scheme (FAS) application<br></u></strong>By
2026, MOE is planning to onboard HOMES (Household Means Eligibility System)
a government-wide system managed by MOH, to access income data for determining
the eligibility of applicants of the MOE FAS.</p>
<p>This system is designed to help government agencies carry out consistent
means-testing for government schemes more efficiently. The proposed implementation
of HOMES would streamline operations and bring substantial benefits to
both applicants and schools. With HOMES, 90% of applicants may no longer
need to submit supporting documents such as income statements, thus making
the application process more convenient and efficient.</p>
<p>MOE also plans to review and simplify the current household and income
definitions, which would further reduce schools' administrative effort
in document verification.</p>
<p>Given the proposed changes and implementation, the school is NOT accepting
any MOE FAS application for 2026 with immediate effect until the new initiatives
and revisions are finalized and rolled out, expected sometime in October
2025.</p>
<p>Families with immediate financial needs can contact the school directly
for assistance.</p>
