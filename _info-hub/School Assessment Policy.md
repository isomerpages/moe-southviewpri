<p><strong><u>Assessment policy<br /></u></strong>For the conduct of the <u>weighted assessment </u>tasks carried out in different terms for&nbsp;<u>P3 to P6</u>, we would like to bring your attention to the following:</p>
<p><u><strong>Observation of punctuality</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>No extra time will be given for late-comers.</li>
<li>For pupils who are late by half an hour or more, they may be barred from sitting for the examination.</li>
</ul>
<p><u><strong>Absence from assessment</strong></u></p>
<ul>
<li>If a pupil is unwell, it is advised that he/she be resting at home, supported by a valid medical certificate from the doctor. Please ask the doctor to indicate your child&rsquo;s diagnosis on the medical certificate as well.&nbsp;</li>
<li>Pupils on medical leave will not be assessed. If they turn up, they will not be allowed to take the assessment unless there is a separate doctor&rsquo;s certificate to certify that they are fit to sit for the assessment.</li>
<li>For any other instances of absence observed, a valid reason (e.g., bereavement), supported with documentary proof, is expected.</li>
<li>For pupils whose external competition/exam dates clash with the internal school examination dates, they are to re-schedule their external competition/exam dates.</li>
<li>No make-up examination will be arranged for the absentees.</li>
</ul>
