<p>Students of South View Primary School play an important role in maintaining a good image of the school.</p>
<p>The following information serves as useful guidelines to help every student measure up the standards of behaviour expected by the school. If a student misbehaves in or outside the school, disciplinary action will be taken against him/her and the incident will be recorded in the School Cockpit System.</p>

<p>We start flag raising punctually at 7.30 am. It is a good habit for students to be in school by 7.30 am. Students who report after 7.30 am will be considered late for school.</p>
<p><strong>2.&nbsp;</strong><strong>National Anthem and Pledge</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>All students must attend the daily flag-raising ceremony.</li>
<li>Students who are Singapore citizens must sing the National Anthem and take the Pledge.</li>
<li>Students will take the pledge with the right fist over the heart.</li>
<li>All students are to stand at attention:
<ul>
<li>when the flag is raised or lowered,</li>
<li>when the National Anthem is being sung, and</li>
<li>during pledge-taking.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>3. Personal Appearance<br /></strong>School Uniform</p>
<ul>
<li>Students must attend school and all school activities in proper school uniform.</li>
<li>Students are to wear the prescribed school uniform and modification to the uniform is not allowed.</li>
<li>Students who report to school during the weekends and holidays must be in school uniform or in appropriate CCA attire.</li>
