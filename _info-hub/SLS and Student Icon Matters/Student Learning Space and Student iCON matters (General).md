<h4><strong>Student Learning Space</strong></h4>
<p>Dear Parents/Guardians,</p>
<p>After the upgrade (evening of Thursday 1st December 2022),&nbsp;your child/ward will be able to continue using the existing SLS username and password for login at the updated login page. If your child/ward knows his/her MOE Identity Management System (MIMS) Login ID and password, he/she can also log in to SLS with MIMS.</p>

<p>The Singapore Student Learning Space (SLS) and Student iCON will be key platforms of our school to support students in their home-based learning (HBL). If your child/ward encounters issue accessing SLS, please follow the steps shown in the SLS recovery poster below.</p>

<p>Please set up a password recovery email within your child's SLS account so that your child can perform a password self-reset.&nbsp;Refer to 'Set Password Reset Email Address' under 'Account Management'&nbsp;from the&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.learning.moe.edu.sg/sls-user-guide/vle/student/index.html">SLS user guide</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Student iCON&nbsp;</strong></h4>
<p>From 2022, your child/ward will be required to use the MOE Student iCON system in his/her course of education in school and it will replace the Southviens G Suite. If your child/ward encounters issue accessing Student iCON, please follow the steps shown in the Student iCON recovery poster below.</p>
