<p>In line with the Ministry of Educationâ€™s (MOE) direction in preparing students for an increasingly complex, interconnected and tech-driven world, the school provides a holistic school experience for our children that includes the use of technology as part of learning. In addition, in building a strong home-school partnership, the school uses various online platforms in our communications on school matters.</p>
<p>To familiarise you and your child with the various platforms that you will be using in the course of the six years that your child will be with us, a summary of these platforms is provided here. These platforms will be used regularly by the school and we hope that you will take time to go through them and guide your child/ward to use them as well.</p>
