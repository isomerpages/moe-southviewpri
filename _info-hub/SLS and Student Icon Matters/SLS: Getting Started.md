<p>The SLS is an online platform with tools and curriculum-aligned resources for all students to learn at their own pace and collaboratively, and can be accessed here: https://learning.moe.edu.sg/<br><br>
With SLS, students can take greater ownership of their learning and pick up skills and habits that prepare them for lifelong learning. Teachers will also use the SLS to complement classroom teaching and learning.</p>
<p>Your child/ward will be able to login to SLS using the following:
</p><ul>- SLS username and password<br><br>
- MIMS username and password</ul><p></p>
<p>Note: For students, the MIMS username is the same as the studentâ€™s iCON email address, ending with @students.edu.sg.</p>
<p>SLS and Student iCON are key platforms used by the school to support students in their learning. If your child/ward encounters issues accessing SLS, please follow the steps shown in the SLS recovery poster below.</p>
